Throughout the graduate school I have had many opportunities to teach graduate level courses at the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://edpsych.education.wisc.edu/). I taught the advanced quantitative courses *Test Construction*, *Factor Analysis*, *Multidimensional Scaling*, and *Cluster Analysis*.

My teaching philosophy adopts culturally affirmative pedagogical methods to help students from different cultures integrate into the classroom more naturally. I encourage my students to think critically about the data analytic methods I teach and the contexts in which these methods are applied. I enjoy how students find unique opportunities to capitalize on the course content to creatively adapt what they have learned to their independent research projects. I find teaching rewarding when students effectively use the subject matter terminology to articulate and answer their research questions.

## Teaching Award at the University of Wisconsin-Madison

I won the [Early Excellence in Teaching Award](https://grad.wisc.edu/2021/03/29/2020-ta-award-winners-honored-for-excellence-in-teaching-and-instructional-continuity/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2020. The Early Excellence in Teaching Award at the graduate school recognizes outstanding and inspirational performance on the part of TAs with fewer than four semesters of teaching experience.
