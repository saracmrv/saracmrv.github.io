### Omitted response patterns in a large-scale language assessment

This study is an exploratory analysis of examinee behavior in a large-scale language proficiency test. Despite a number-right scoring system with no penalty for guessing, we found that 16% of examinees omitted at least one answer and that women were more likely than men to omit answers. Item-response theory analyses treating the omitted responses as missing rather than wrong showed that examinees had underperformed by skipping the answers, with a greater underperformance among more able participants. An analysis of omitted answer patterns showed that reading passage items were most likely to be omitted, and that native language-translation items were least likely to be omitted. We hypothesized that since reading passage items were most tempting to skip, then among examinees who did answer every question there might be a tendency to guess at these items. Using cluster analyses, we found that underperformance on the reading items was more likely than underperformance on the non-reading passage items. In large-scale operational tests, examinees must know the optimal strategy for taking the test. Test developers must also understand how examinee behavior might impact the validity of score interpretations. [PDF](https://doi.org/10.1080/15305058.2022.2070756)

### Preservice teachers' understanding of complex numbers

This study investigated a prospective secondary mathematics teacher's development of the meaning of the Cartesian form of complex numbers during a teaching experiment. We illustrate that through shrinking/stretching of the distance(s) between the roots and the x-coordinate of the vertex of any quadratic function one might conceptualize complex numbers as a single entity, element of a well-defined set, rather than a prescription of certain operations. Such awareness also yield to answering why quadratic functions have to have conjugate roots once they have a complex root.
