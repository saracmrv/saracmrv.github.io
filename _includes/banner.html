      <p>I am a psychometrician in the Office of Research and Psychometrics - Learning & Assessment at the College Board since 2023, 
		focusing on Advanced Placement (AP) psychometrics. I received my PhD from the Quantitative Methods within the Department
        of Educational Psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2023, specializing in measurement. I work on the
        theory and application of psychometric methods (e.g., latent variable models, mainly item response theory (IRT))
        in education and psychology. I am trained to develop measuring instruments, design and
        conduct experiments and surveys, and analyze data resulting from these activities for providing evidence-based insights.
        I conduct research on statistics and psychometrics in education- and psychology-related fields.
        My research focuses on (1) statistical modeling of
        aberrant test-taking behavior in educational and
        psychological measurement and (2) psychometric methodologies for the item- and
        person-level anomaly detection in the form of test collusion and item preknowledge
        as well as their potential to provide insight into valid and fair testing. 
		  More recently, I work on test security, IRT calibrations, and modern standard setting methods as well as 
		  using AI to improve research and operations in these domains.
