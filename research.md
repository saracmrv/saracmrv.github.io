I am an imaging scientist.  My interest in medical imaging came as a result of waterski accident which led to a traumatic brain injury which in turn led to many CT scans when I was in high school.  As an undergraduate, I found a perfect intersection between improving human health care and the elegance of the mathematics and physics that form the framework of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  I have been fortunate to work on technical problems in the medical field in both my graduate work and my post-doc and hope to continue working in this domain throughout my career.
