## Several rewarding highlights about my teaching from my students' perspectives:

*"... put in all her effort, her full potential, and unquestionable ability, and her heart in her classes... can teach anybody with any level of knowledge."*

*"... interactive in discussion section and encouraging of students."*

*"... gets prepared so well for the class... explains all the points in detail and posts assignments that are so closely associated with the contents."*

*"... always on point. Her teaching style is really impressive. She not only knows the content super well, she can explain it in multiple different ways so a range of people can understand what she is saying... while her lectures were dense at times, she did a fantastic job explaining things in understandable ways (including drawing on the board)..."*
